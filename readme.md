Avatar TTS App

A simplified Python application that integrates a pre-trained Text-to-Speech (TTS) model with facial animation to generate talking avatar videos using text input.

* Features

* Generate synthetic voice using ElevenLabs (pre-trained TTS)

* Upload generated audio to D-ID

* Create a realistic facial animation with a simple avatar

* Play audio locally & transcribe it back using Speech-to-Text

* Open final animated video automatically in browser

* Store interaction history for debugging/demo

* Objective

Develop a simplified version where a synthetic voice is synchronized with basic facial animations using a simple avatar and text input only.

This was built for an interview assignment with the following evaluation criteria:

Accuracy of speech-to-text and text-to-speech

Realism of facial animations

Overall user experience

* Tech Stack

Python 3.11+

ElevenLabs API (TTS)

D-ID API (Avatar Animation)

PyAudio + Pydub (Audio Playback)

SpeechRecognition (STT)

* Setup Instructions

Clone the repo:
