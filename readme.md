Avatar TTS App

A simplified Python application that integrates a pre-trained Text-to-Speech (TTS) model with facial animation to generate talking avatar videos using text input.

* Features

* Generate synthetic voice using ElevenLabs (pre-trained TTS)

* Upload generated audio to D-ID

* Create a realistic facial animation with a simple avatar

* Play audio locally & transcribe it back using Speech-to-Text

* Open final animated video automatically in browser

* Store interaction history for debugging/demo

* Objective

Develop a simplified version where a synthetic voice is synchronized with basic facial animations using a simple avatar and text input only.

This was built for an interview assignment with the following evaluation criteria:

Accuracy of speech-to-text and text-to-speech

Realism of facial animations

Overall user experience

* Tech Stack

Python 3.11+

ElevenLabs API (TTS)

D-ID API (Avatar Animation)

PyAudio + Pydub (Audio Playback)

SpeechRecognition (STT)

* Setup Instructions

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/avatar-tts-app
cd avatar-tts-app

Create virtual environment & install dependencies:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set your API keys:
Update tts.py and d_id_api.py with your ElevenLabs and D-ID API credentials.

Run the App:

python main.py

## ðŸ§  Methodology

This application takes user text input, generates speech using ElevenLabs (TTS), then synchronizes it with a simple avatar using D-ID's API to produce a talking head video. The generated voice is also transcribed back using Google STT to demonstrate accuracy.
