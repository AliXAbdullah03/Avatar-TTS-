# Avatar TTS App

A simplified Python application that integrates a pre-trained Text-to-Speech (TTS) model with facial animation to generate talking avatar videos using text input.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Generate synthetic voice using ElevenLabs (pre-trained TTS)
- ✅ Upload generated audio to D-ID
- ✅ Create a realistic facial animation with a simple avatar
- ✅ Play audio locally & transcribe it back using Speech-to-Text
- ✅ Open final animated video automatically in browser
- ✅ Store interaction history for debugging/demo

---

## 🎯 Objective

> Develop a simplified version where a synthetic voice is synchronized with basic facial animations using a simple avatar and text input only.

This was built for an interview assignment with the following evaluation criteria:
- Accuracy of speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- Realism of facial animations
- Overall user experience
